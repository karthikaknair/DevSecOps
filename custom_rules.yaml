    message: |
      Found 'document.write'. This function is dangerous as it can easily
      lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, especially if
      it uses user-controlled input (even indirectly).
      
      **Recommendation:** Use safer DOM manipulation methods like 
      `element.textContent = ...` or `element.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', ...)` 
      with proper input sanitization.
